function [h,c]=selesnickFIRantisymmetric_linear_differentiator(N,K)
% [h,c]=selesnickFIRantisymmetric_linear_differentiator(N,K)
% Implement Selesnick's algorithm for the closed-form design of an even- or
% odd-order,  odd- or even-length, anti-symmetric, linear-phase, low-pass,
% maximally-linear at omega=0, FIR differentiator filters.
%
% Inputs:
%   N - filter length (filter order is N-1)
%   K - number of zeros at z=-1
%
% Outputs:
%   h - coefficients of the anti-symmetric FIR differentiator filter
%   c - coefficients of the maximally-flat components (ie [-1;2;-1]/4)
%
% This function closely follows the chebdiff.m MATLAB function of Selesnick
% for even length filters and adds the case of odd length filters. See
% Section IV of "Exchange Algorithms for the Design of Linear Phase
% FIR Filters and Differentiators Having Flat Monotonic Passbands and
% Equiripple %Stopband", Ivan W. Selesnick and C. Sidney Burrus, IEEE
