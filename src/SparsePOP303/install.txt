1. Overview

1.1 Two Versions

Two versions of SparsePOP are available in this package:
   (A) MATLAB only version
   (B) MATLAB with C++ version
(A) is always installed, while (B) is optional.

The functionality of the two is idential, but (B) is much faster
than (A) in generating SDP problems, because some of the time
consuming parts are rewritten in C++. We recommend to use (B)
whenever possible, although in many cases (A) is sufficient.

1.2 System Requirements

The following softwares is the minimum requirement:

  i. MATLAB R2009b or later for Mac OSX
     MATLAB R2008a or later for Linux

  ii. SDP sovlers (SeDuMi, SDPT3, SDPA or CSDP)
	 to call SeDuMi from SparsePOP for solving an SDP relaxation problem

Be sure that you have an appropriate version of SeDuMi
for your MATLAB. For example, if you are using
MATLAB R2009b or later, then you need SeDuMi 1.1R3 or later.

If you want to use (B), then you need appropriate C++ compilers,
compatible with MATLAB, to compile the programs.

NOTE: SDP solvers which can be available at SparsePOP are
SeDuMi, SDPA, SDPT3, CSDP and SDPNAL.


2. Quick Installation Guide for MacOSX 10.4.8 or later

If you want to install the C++ version (B), in addition to
MATLAB and SeDuMi, you need Xcode, distributed by Apple.
Be sure that you have an appropriate version of Xcode.
See:
   http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html
For example, if you are using MATLAB 7.4 or later,
then you must use:
   Xcode 2.4.1 or later
	--available from http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/

  Installation steps:

(NOTE: Skip the step marked with * if C++ version is not needed.)

  2.1 Download SparsePOP from:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparsepop/

  2.2 Unpack it by either:
	double-clicking the icon, or typing on the Terminal:
	% tar zxvf sparsePOP300.tar.gz

	You will get a folder named SparsePOP303

  2.3 Move the folder to any place you like, say, to
	/Users/smith/matlab/SparsePOP303 (if you are Smith),
	or, if you want to install SparsePOP machine-wide, to
	/Applications/MATLAB74/toolbox/shared/SparsePOP300

*2.4 Invoke MATLAB, and choose Compiler. In MATLAB, type:
	>> mex -setup
	and follow the message to choose a compiler.
    If you can use llvm-gcc and llvm-g++, then edit your
    mexopts.sh. See the following url for the detail: 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/103258-mex-on-mavericks-with-r2012b

  2.5 In MATLAB, and cd to the folder of SparsePOP303.
	>> cd /Users/smith/matlab/SparsePOP303

*2.6 Compile C++ codes from MATLAB window:
	>> compileSparsePOP

  2.7 Set MATLAB-path to SparsePOP300. Specifically,
	Choose: File->Set Path
	Push 'Add with Subfolders...' bottun, and 
	Select the folder SparsePOP303.
	Finally, Save it by pushing 'Save' bottun.

  2.8 Now you are ready to use SparsePOP.
	Test it by typing
	>> sparsePOP('example1.gms');

NOTE: If you want to use MATLAB in the mode matlab -nodisply, 
it is useful to add the path of the directory of SparsePOP in 
your startup.m. If your SparsePOP is installed in 
/Users/matlab/SparsePOP303, write the following command in your 
startup.m:

addpath(genpath('/Users/matlab/SparsePOP303'));


3. Quick Installation Guide for Linux

If you want to install the C++ version (B), in addition to
MATLAB and SeDuMi, you need gcc compilers, a free software
distributed by GNU. Be sure that you have an appropriate
version of gcc.
See:
   http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html
For example, if you are using MATLAB R2007a or later, then
you must have:
	gcc/g++ version 4.1.1 or later, and
	appropriate kernel and glibc.

  Installation steps

(NOTE: Skip the step marked with * if C++ version is not needed.)


  3.1 Download SparsePOP from:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparsepop/

  3.2 Unpack it by either:
	double-clicking the icon, or typing on the terminal:
	% tar zxvf sparsePOP303.tar.gz

	You will get a directory named SparsePOP303

  3.3 Move the directory to any place you like, say, to
	/home/smith/matlab/SparsePOP300 (if you are Smith),
	or, if you want to install SparsePOP machine-widely, to
	/usr/matlab2007a/toolbox/shared/SparsePOP303

*3.4 Invoke MATLAB, and choose Compiler. In MATLAB, type:
	>> mex -setup
	and follow the message to choose a compiler.

  3.5 In MATLAB, and cd to the folder of SparsePOP303.
	>> cd /Users/smith/matlab/SparsePOP303

*3.6 Compile C++ codes from MATLAB window:
	>> compileSparsePOP

  3.7 Set MATLAB-path to SparsePOP303. Specifically,
	Choose: File->Set Path
	Push 'Add with Subfolders...' bottun, and 
	Select the folder SparsePOP303.
	Finally, Save it by pushing 'Save' bottun.
 
  3.8 Now you are ready to use SparsePOP.
	Test it by typing
	>> sparsePOP('example1.gms');

NOTE: If you want to use MATLAB in the mode matlab -nodisply, 
it is useful to add the path of the directory of SparsePOP in 
your startup.m. If your SparsePOP is installed in 
/home/matlab/SparsePOP303, write the following command in your 
startup.m:

addpath(genpath('/home/matlab/SparsePOP303'));

4. Quick Installation Guide for Windows 7

If you want to install the C++ version (B), in addition to
MATLAB and SeDuMi, you need an appropriate C++ compilers.
See:
   http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html
We have tested it by Microsoft Visual C++ 2005.

(NOTE: Skip the step marked with * if C++ version is not needed.)

  4.1 Download SparsePOP from:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparsepop/

  4.2 Unpack it double-clicking the icon.
	You may need an appropriate software for unpacking the
	tar.gz file.

	You will get a folder named SparsePOP303

  4.3 Move the folder to, say, C:\MATLAB\SparsePOP303

*4.4 Invoke MATLAB, and choose Compiler. In MATLAB, type:
	>> mex -setup
