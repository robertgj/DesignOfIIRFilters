1. System Requirements

The following softwares is the minimum requirement:

  i.   MATLAB 7 or later.
	 -- available from Mathworks inc.
  ii. C++ compilers, compatible with MATLAB, to compile 
       C++ codes. 
  iii. SeDuMi 1.1R3 or later
	-- available from http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/ 
	to call sedumi.m from sparseCoLO for solving an SDP
  and/or
  iv. sdpa.7.3.1 or later  
	-- available from http://sdpa.indsys.chuo-u.ac.jp/sdpa/
	to call sedumiwrap.m from sparseCoLO for solving an SDP
  and/or
  v. SDPT3-4.0-beta or later
	-- available from http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3.html
	to call sqlp.m from sparseCoLO for solving an SDP

NOTE1: Be sure that you have an appropriate version of SeDuMi
for your MATLAB. For example, if you are using
SeDuMi 1.2 64bit version, then you need Matlab R2007b or later.

NOTE2: In the case of iv, sdpa.7.3.1 does not work in Matlab R2009a, so  
use Matlab R2006b --- R2008b. Add a path to sedumiwrap (SDPAM),  
       ~/sdpa/sdpa.7.3.1/mex/
in Matlab.

2. Quick Installation Guide for MacOSX 10.4.8 or later

You need Xcode, distributed by Apple. Be sure that you have an 
appropriate version of Xcode. See:
   http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html
For example, if you are using MATLAB 7.4 or later,
then you must use:
   Xcode 2.4.1 or later
	--available from http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/

  Installation steps:

  2.1 Download SparseCoLO111 

  2.2 Unpack it by either:
	double-clicking the icon, or typing on the Terminal:
	% tar zxvf SparseCoLO111.tar.gz

	You will get a folder named SparseCoLO111

  2.3 Move the folder to any place you like, say, to
	/Users/smith/matlab/SparseCoLO111 (if your account name is smith),
	or, if you want to install SparseCoLO machine-wide, to
	/Applications/MATLAB74/toolbox/shared/SparseCoLO111

  2.4 Invoke MATLAB, and cd to the folder of SparseCoLO111.
	>> cd /Users/smith/matlab/SparseCoLO111

  2.5 Compile C++ codes from MATLAB window:
	>> compileSparseCoLO

  2.6 Set MATLAB-path to SparseCoLO111. Specifically,
	Choose: File->Set Path
	Push 'Add with Subfolders...' bottun, and 
	Select the folder SparseCoLO111.
	Finally, Save it by pushing 'Save' bottun.

  2.7 Set MATLAB-path to SeDuMi 1.1R3 (or later) and/or sdpa.7.3.1 (or later) and/or 
      SDPT3-4.0-beta (or later). For the path to sdpa.7.3.1, add a path to sedumiwrap,  
       ~/sdpa/sdpa.7.3.1/mex/  in Matlab.

  2.8 Now you are ready to use SparseCoLO.
	Test it by typing
	>> [A,b,c,K,J] = maxCutSDP(1,50,4,2009);
	>> parCoLO.domain = 1; parCoLO.range = 0; parCoLO.EQorLMI = 1;
	>> [x,y,infoCoLO,cliqueDomain,cliqueRange,LOP] = sparseCoLO(A,b,c,K,J,parCoLO);

NOTE1: If you want to use MATLAB in the mode matlab -nodisply, 
it is useful to add the path of the directory of SparseCoLO in 
your startup.m. If your SparseCoLO is installed in 
/home/smith/matlab/SparseCoLO111, write the following command in your 
startup.m:
	addpath(genpath('/home/smith/matlab/SparseCoLO111'));
If your SeDuMi_1_1 is installed in /home/smith/matlab/SeDuMi_1_1, 
write the following command in your startup.m:
	addpath(genpath('/home/smith/matlab/SeDuMi_1_1'));
If your sdpa is installed in /home/smith/sdpa, write the following command 
in your startup.m:
	addpath(genpath('/home/smith/sdpa/sdpa.7.3.1/mex'));
If your SDPT3-4.0-beta is installed in /home/smith/matlab/SDPT3-4.0-beta, 
write the following command in your startup.m:
	addpath(genpath('/home/smith/matlab/SDPT3-4.0-beta'));

3. Quick Installation Guide for Linux

You need gcc compilers, a free software
distributed by GNU. Be sure that you have an appropriate
version of gcc. See:
   http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html
For example, if you are using MATLAB R2007a or later, then
you must have:
	gcc/g++ version 4.1.1 or later, and
	appropriate kernel and glibc.

  Installation steps

  3.3 Move the directory to any place you like, say, to
	/home/smith/matlab/SparseCoLO111 (if you account name is smith),
	or, if you want to install SparseCoLO machine-widely, to
	/usr/matlab2007a/toolbox/shared/SparseCoLO111

4. Quick Installation Guide for Windows XP and Vista

You need an appropriate C++ compilers. See:
   http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html
We have tested it by Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition.

  Installation steps:

  4.1 Download  SparseCoLO111

  4.2 Unpack it double-clicking the icon.
      You may need an appropriate software for unpacking the
      tar.gz file. You will get a folder named  SparseCoLO111.

  4.3 Move the folder to, say,
      C:\Documents and Settings\smith\MATLAB\SparseCoLO111
      if your account name is smith.

  4.4 Choose Compiler. In the MATLAB, type:
	> mex -setup
	and follow the message to choose a compiler.

  4.6 Invoke MATLAB, and cd to the above folder.
	>> cd C:\Documents and Settings\smith\MATLAB\SparseCoLO111

  4.7 Compile C++ codes from MATLAB window:
	>> compileSparseCoLO

  4.6 Set MATLAB-path to SparseCoLO111. Specifically,
	Choose: File->Set Path
	Push 'Add with Subfolders...' bottun, and 
	Select the folder SparseCoLO111.
	Finally, Save it by pushing 'Save' bottun.

  4.7 Set MATLAB-path to SeDuMi 1.1R3 (or later) and/or SDPT3-4.0-beta (or later). 
       For the path to sdpa.7.3.1, add a path to sedumiwrap,  
       ~/sdpa/sdpa.7.3.1/mex/  in Matlab.

  4.8 Now you are ready to use SparsePOP.
	Test it by typing
	>> [A,b,c,K,J] = maxCutSDP(1,50,4,2009);
	>> parCoLO.domain = 1; parCoLO.range = 0; parCoLO.EQorLMI = 1;
	>> [x,y,infoCoLO,cliqueDomain,cliqueRange,LOP] = sparseCoLO(A,b,c,K,J,parCoLO);

NOTE1: If you want to use MATLAB in the mode matlab -nodisply,
